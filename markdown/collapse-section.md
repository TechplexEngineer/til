Collapse Section
================

Both Gitlab and Github properly render the html tag `<details>` which allows collapsing a section of information.


```
<details><summary>A summary of what is collapsed. Click to expand!</summary>
<pre>
Some code here!
<pre>
</details>
```
<details><summary>A summary of what is collapsed. Click to expand!</summary>
<pre>
Some code here!
<pre>
</details>

## An example without pre tags for non-code like things:

```
<details><summary>A summary of what is collapsed. Click to expand!</summary>
Some code here!
</details>
```
<details><summary>A summary of what is collapsed. Click to expand!</summary>
Some code here!
</details>
